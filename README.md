# Lucky Lottery Ticket Checker
This Java program checks whether a lottery ticket is lucky. A six-digit number on a lottery ticket is considered lucky if the sum of the first three digits is equal to the sum of the last three digits, and all the digits on the ticket are unique.

The program takes the ticket number as input from the command line. For example: 628745.

It continuously prompts for ticket numbers until it finds the first lucky ticket, and then it prints out how many tickets were checked in total.
